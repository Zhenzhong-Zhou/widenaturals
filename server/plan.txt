----------------------
Finding the User:

The function first attempts to find a user by the provided username using User.findOne({ username }).
Password Verification:

The password entered by the user is compared to the hashed password stored in the database using bcrypt.compare(password, user.password).
JWT Creation:

If the username and password are correct, a JWT is created using jwt.sign. The payload contains the user ID and role (you can add more fields as needed). The token is signed with a secret key stored in your environment variables.
Token Return:

The generated token is then returned to the client. The client can use this token to authenticate future requests.
Error Handling:

The function includes basic error handling for common issues, such as incorrect credentials or server errors.
Security Considerations:
Use HTTPS: Ensure that your application uses HTTPS to secure the transmission of tokens.
Environment Variables: Store your JWT_SECRET securely and never hardcode it in your source code.
Token Expiry: Adjust the token expiration time according to your security requirements.
This is a basic implementation. Depending on your requirements, you might need to add more features, such as:

Account Lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for added security.
Refresh Tokens if you want to issue short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens to manage sessions.



Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): If your application requires higher security,
implement 2FA as an additional step after a successful password verification.

Client-Side Validation: Perform basic validations on the client side, like checking for empty fields, but always enforce the security checks server-side.

Security Best Practices: Ensure all responses are secured using HTTPS to protect data in transit.
Also, consider logging out users from all sessions if they change their password or after a specific period of inactivity.


---------- Control Access -----

Best Practice Recommendation
Consider a Hybrid Approach:

Role Hierarchy: Implement a hierarchical role system where the "manager" role automatically includes all permissions of the "employee" role. This way, when you assign the "manager" role to a user, they automatically inherit "employee" permissions.
Separate Permissions: If you need to differentiate between "manager"-specific and "employee"-specific actions, you can still have separate permissions within each role. The "manager" role would have additional permissions on top of the inherited "employee" permissions.
Example Design:
Role Hierarchy:

employee role: Base level permissions.
manager role: Inherits all employee permissions and adds additional manager-specific permissions.
Role Inheritance Logic:

In your application, define that the manager role automatically includes employee permissions.
Ensure that when you assign the manager role, the system treats the user as having both manager and employee permissions.


1. Development and Local Environment:
Write Migrations: Start by writing Knex migration files that define the changes you need to make (e.g., adding a new table, altering an existing table to add a new column).
Test Migrations: Run the migrations in your local or development environment to ensure they work as expected. This helps catch any issues before they affect production.
Apply Changes: Make any necessary adjustments to your application code to work with the new or modified database schema.
Run Seeds (if necessary): If the new table or column requires initial data, you can also create and test seed files in your local or development environment.
2. Production Environment:
Backup: Before making any changes to the production database, create a backup to prevent data loss in case something goes wrong.
Run Migrations in Production:
Once the migrations have been thoroughly tested in development, they can be run in production. This step should be part of your deployment process.
Ensure you have a rollback plan in place in case something goes wrong (Knex allows you to rollback migrations).
Apply Changes to Production Code: Deploy your application code that works with the new schema after the migration is successfully applied.
Best Practices:
Version Control: Ensure that your migration files are version-controlled along with your application code.
This allows you to track changes and maintain consistency across environments.
Incremental Changes: Apply schema changes incrementally to avoid large, complex migrations that are difficult to rollback if necessary.
Communication: Coordinate with your team, especially if multiple developers are working on the same project, to avoid conflicts in database changes.
Testing: Always test migrations and application changes in a staging environment that closely mirrors production before deploying them to production.
Summary:
Development/Local: Write and test migrations and seeds. Apply and test changes locally.
Production: Carefully apply tested migrations to production, ensuring backups are in place and you have a rollback plan.
